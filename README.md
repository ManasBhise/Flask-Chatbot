## Project Description  

This is a chatbot that allows users to convert currencies using natural language queries. The chatbot is built using Flask and Dialogflow, integrating with the Currency Freaks API to fetch real-time exchange rates.  

The chatbot receives user queries via Dialogflow, extracts relevant parameters like the source currency, target currency, and amount, and returns the converted amount using a backend Flask API. The project is deployed on Render for public accessibility.
